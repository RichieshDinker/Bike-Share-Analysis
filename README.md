# Cyclistic-bike-share (Google Data Analytics Capstone Project)

## Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes 
differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### Introduction
This is a case study on analysing bike usage pattern of different customer base of a company called 'Cyclistic'. Being the junior data analyst of the Cyclistic's marketing team, I am expected to answer key business questions and provide valuable insights and recommendations based on analysis.

### Business Problem
What is the past usage pattern of casual riders and annual members?
Should the marketing campaign be focussed on gaining new members or in converting casual riders to annual members?
